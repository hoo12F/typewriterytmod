**_A Youtube Mod_**<br>
## IMPORTANT!
*This is not a real project, just an example of a good README file for my other projects.*
**Version 1.0.0 (demo)**
so. Mods. And a programmer who doesn't know anything about making them but does anyways. For the first time.
I created this absolute piece of trash because i wanted to try out modding stuff. There was no effort put into this, and i might give up on the entire thing if I'm too lazy to update it.
